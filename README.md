 ##ðŸ“¸ ImgScrap
 
This script scrapes mobile phone images from GSMArena's website for various brands and saves them locally. It uses Python's `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to fetch and parse web pages, and implements user-agent rotation to minimize the chance of being blocked by the server.


 ##ðŸš€ Features

- **Multi-brand scraping:** Scrapes phone images from GSMArena for multiple brands.
- **Pagination:** Automatically navigates through pages to fetch all images.
- **User-Agent Rotation:** Uses random user-agents to avoid being flagged as a bot.
- **Save Images:** Saves images to organized folders by brand.
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Skips downloading images already saved locally.
- **Error Handling:** Handles HTTP errors and missing elements gracefully.
